# Theater-Ticketing-System


When the user selects the request tickets menu option, the program should prompt for the
number of seats the patron wants. A function should then be called and passed this
information so that it can handle the ticket request. If any of the requested seats do not
exist, or are not available, an appropriate message should be displayed. If the seats exist
and are available, a bill should be printed that lists the number of requested seats, the price
per seat in the requested row, and the total price for the seats. Then the user program
should ask if the patron wishes to purchase these seats.
